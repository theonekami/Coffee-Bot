```Shoot your body 
Into the moonlight 
Even if I 
Tried to cancel 
Oh, the pictures 
Into the mind 
There's a flashing in my eyes. 
Don't you see my 
Commission? 
The picture? 
There's com- and runn-ing again, 
Can't you see now 
Emotions 
Riding into your mind...? 

==Chorus== 
Déjà Vu! 
I've just been in this place before! 
(Higher on the street!) 
And I know it's my time to come home! 
Calling you! 
And the subject's a mystery! 
(Standing on my feet!) 
It's so hard when I try to believe! 
Whooooaaa!! 
Déjà Vu! 
I've just been in this time before! 
(Higher on the beat!) 
And I know it's a place to come home! 
Calling you! 
And the subject's a mystery! 
(Standing on my feet!) 
It's so hard when I try to believe! 
Yeeeaaaaaah!! 
========= 

Save the future 
Into the present 
See my past feels 
In the distance 
Try to guess now 
What's going on 
And the band begins to play. 
Don't you see my 
Commission? 
The Picture? 
There's come and running again, 
Can't you see now 
Emotions 
Riding into your mind...```
